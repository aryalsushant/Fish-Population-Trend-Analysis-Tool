# Fish Population Trend Analysis Tool

## Project Overview
The **Fish Population Trend Analysis Tool** is a Python-based data analysis project designed to explore and visualize trends in fish population data over time. The project focuses on processing real-world datasets, cleaning them, and generating meaningful visualizations to help researchers, environmentalists, and fisheries managers understand changes in fish populations.

## What the Project Does

### Data Cleaning
- Processes raw fish population data from CSV files by handling missing or invalid values (e.g., replacing `.` with `0`).
- Removes unnecessary columns, such as status flags, to focus on the relevant data.

### Data Reshaping
- Converts the dataset from a **wide format** (years as columns) to a **long format** (years as rows), making it easier to analyze trends over time.

### Analysis
- Allows users to analyze population trends for specific species, countries, or fishing areas.
- Groups and summarizes data to calculate total population by year or other criteria.

### Visualization
- Generates line plots to show how the population of a specific fish species (e.g., FCY) has changed over time.
- Provides clear, interactive visualizations to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

### Data Export
- Saves the cleaned and reshaped data into a new CSV file for future use or further analysis.

## Technologies Used

### Python
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.

### Dataset
- Real-world fish population data from **OpenFisheries** or similar sources.

### Development Environment
- **Virtual Environment**: To manage dependencies and ensure reproducibility.

## Use Cases
- **Research**: Helps scientists analyze long-term fish population trends for conservation and sustainability studies.
- **Policy Making**: Provides insights for fisheries managers to set sustainable fishing quotas.
- **Education**: Acts as a learning tool for understanding data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Key Takeaways
- The tool makes complex datasets easier to understand through cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- By focusing on species-level or country-level trends, it allows users to derive actionable insights.
- It demonstrates the power of Python for solving real-world data challenges.
